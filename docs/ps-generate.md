# PS-generate

Prescale table generation tool

## Basic usage

Use this tool to create a new prescale table according to a new L1 Menu, using information from an existing prescale table.

### Working with local files

Use the tool by running the Python script and passing both an existing prescale
table and a given L1 menu (see example below).

```
python psgenerate.py PStable.xlsx L1Menu.xml
```

### Download files on-the-fly

It is also possible to pass URLs instead of the local filepaths of a prescale
table or an XML menu, as the following example demonstrates.

```
python psgenerate.py https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1Menu2018/raw/master/official/PrescaleTables/PrescaleTable-1_L1Menu_Collisions2018_v2_1_0.xlsx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1Menu2018/master/official/XMLs/L1Menu_CollisionsHeavyIons2018_v4_0_0.xml
```

The files are stored in temporary directories and are
removed by the operating system automatically. No need for manual cleanup.

> The given URLs must refer to files that are downloadable via `wget`.


### Optional arguments:
* `-output`: Specify the name of the output file, without file extension
  (*default: "new_PStable"*)

If run successfully, the tool creates a new xlsx file ("PStable_new.xlsx") which
contains the seeds of the passed L1 menu XML with their corresponding prescale
values (if they existed in the passed PS table).

A summary of the prescale values that are missing in the input file is finally
printed to the terminal, including the estimated values for the respective
prescale table columns. It is up to the user to fill/check those values.
